## CAN I Invent HTML Tags and give them some style in my CSS ?

Answer : yes & no  
it will work sometimes, but it's totally advised against doing so, because it will make your code a mess, for you, and for other developer that will work on your code, and mostly because it may not work in the future, and it may not work on every browsers.

you should stick to official tags list : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

Why does it work ? because at first, web browsers was very tolerant, rules were unclear.  Websites bloomed in this anarchy. Telling the browser to become strict about it afterwards would have broke many websites.

## CSS Selectors recap

Now that you've spent some time writing CSS, let's sum up the Rules.
You've learned that to give style to some elements of your page, before opening curly brackets to set the style properties, you must write a specific selector in your css.

Here are your options : 

|Selector Type | Syntax | Elements affected|
|---|---|---|
|Element Selector|p| All `<p>` elements|
|Id Selector|#abc| Elements with **id="abc"**|
|Class Selector|.abc| Elements with **class="abc"**|
|Element Class Selector|p.abc| `<p>` elements with **class="abc"**|
|Descendent selector|div strong| `<strong>` elements that are descendants of a `<div>`|
|Comma selector|h2,div| `<h2>` elements and `<div>` elements|

    p {
        color: green;
    }

    #abc {
        color: blue;
    }

    .abc {
        color: red;
    }

    p.abc {
        color: purple;
    }

    div strong {
        color: yellow;
    }

    h2,div{
        color: brown;
    }


And don't forget:

- if there is style conflicts in your css, the most specific rule prevails
- Styles are inherited from parent to child. if you give style to BODY, all the page will have the style. ( except layout-related properties. )
- Your browser have a default style sheet. The one you see if you click inspect on a page with no associated style.
- HTML should contain content NOT style, CSS should contain style NOT content


## Most of you already know this, but just to be sure:

- In case you have not read last time, read this at list once (5mn read) : https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp
- Just in case you are not clear about margin, border, padding , read this short version : https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
- If you forgot `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` in the HEAD section of your html, your mobile browser will render at desktop screen width ( 1000px) and then zoom out. You will have a tiny undreadable website on you mobile.
- Using media queries in your css, you will then be able to give specific styles depending on the screen width.

## WS 4.1 CSS animations

CSS animations allows to create animated transitions between values of your css properties such as color, background-color, height, or width.
